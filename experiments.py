		Measure the information gain and probing speed for direct and remote probing.

		Generate or choose target hops with various number of channels.
		Probe the target hops in direct and remote mode (if prober is provided), using BS and NBS amount choice methods.
		Measure and plot the final achieved information gain and probing speed.

		Parameters:
		- prober: the Prober object (None to run only direct probing on synthetic hops)
		- num_target_hops: how many target hops to choose / generate
		- num_runs_per_experiments: how many experiments to run (gain and speed are averaged)
		- min_num_channels: the minimal number of channels in hops to consider
		- max_num_channels: the maximal number of channels in hops to consider
		- use_snapshot:
			if False, run only direct probing on synthetic hops; 
			if True, run direct and remote probing on synthetic and snapshot hops.
		- jamming: use jamming (after h and g are fully probed without jamming)

		Return: None (saves the resulting plots)
